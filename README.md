# frenzy-app-monitor
Request-based Java application leveraging threads, API integration, HTML scraping, and OCR techniques to monitor and notify users of limited merchandise released via Frenzy Shopping App

Specifically, this project monitored:
- New product releases on Frenzy
- New restock of sought after products on Frenzy
- Any associated data with product releases
  - Store location,
  - Product release start time,
  - If it was pickup only,
  - If there was global shipping,
  - What coordinates your phone had to be in to access the drop (many products were geo-locked, project would provide you exact coordinates you could spoof your location to)
